<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will be completing a multi-client TCP/IP chat server.
Users of your server will be able to connect, change their preferred nick name,
create and join other named channels, exchange chat messages and see who else
is currently connected to the server. Starter code has been provided that lays
a foundation of the data structures used to maintain the server, clients and
channels, but the implementation still requires the core socket setup code and <code>select</code>
event loop to allow incoming connections. You will implement this, as well as
add several features to let users interact with the server and communicate with
their fellow peers.</p>
<p>Please read over this entire handout at least <strong>twice</strong> before you get started,
so that you have a clear picture of what you have to do.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>A completed, fully functional chat server is currently running on CDF on port
<strong>20209</strong>. You can connect to this server using the already provided
<code>chatclient</code>, which you can build yourself from the starter code or can be
found pre-built under <code>/u/csc209h/summer/pub/bin/chatclient</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">wolf:~$</span> /u/csc209h/summer/pub/bin/chatclient localhost 20209
<span class="go">Connection to 127.0.0.1 port 20209 succeeded!</span>
<span class="go">! Welcome to the CSC209 Chat Server</span>
<span class="go">! Type /help &lt;ENTER&gt; to see a list of available commands</span>
<span class="go"> * @user2 has joined #csc209</span>
<span class="go">@user2 #csc209&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The chat client provides a slightly easier to use interface (it lets the server
change the prompt and won't trample text you are currently writing while other
messages are received), but the protocol for this server is fundamentally text
based, meaning that you can just as well connect and interact with the server
using <em>netcat</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">wolf:~$</span> /bin/nc -v localhost 20209
<span class="go">Connection to localhost 20209 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</span>
<span class="go">! Welcome to the CSC209 Chat Server</span>
<span class="go">! Type /help &lt;ENTER&gt; to see a list of available commands</span>
<span class="go"> * @user2 has joined #csc209</span>
<span class="go">/prompt @user2 #csc209</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Try connecting to the server via both means, and then try the <code>/help</code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">wolf:~$</span> /u/csc209h/summer/pub/bin/chatclient localhost 20209
<span class="go">Connection to 127.0.0.1 port 20209 succeeded!</span>
<span class="go">! Welcome to the CSC209 Chat Server</span>
<span class="go">! Type /help &lt;ENTER&gt; to see a list of available commands</span>
<span class="go"> * @user2 has joined #csc209</span>
<span class="go">@user2 #csc209&gt; /help</span>
<span class="go">! Command help for the CSC209 Chat Server</span>
<span class="go">! ---------------------------------------</span>
<span class="go">!</span>
<span class="go">! Display this help message:</span>
<span class="go">!      /help</span>
<span class="go">!</span>
<span class="go">! Join a named channel:</span>
<span class="go">!      /join &lt;channel&gt;</span>
<span class="go">!</span>
<span class="go">! Set your nick name on this server:</span>
<span class="go">!      /nick &lt;name&gt;</span>
<span class="go">!</span>
<span class="go">! Disconnect from this server:</span>
<span class="go">!      /disconnect</span>
<span class="go">!</span>
<span class="go">! List all the current channels on this server:</span>
<span class="go">!      /channels</span>
<span class="go">!</span>
<span class="go">! List all the currently connected clients on this server:</span>
<span class="go">!      /who</span>
<span class="go">!</span>
<span class="go">@user2 #csc209&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The server accepts commands beginning with a <code>/</code>. You can change your nick name wing <code>/nick</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">@user2 #csc209&gt; /nick astudent</span>
<span class="go"> * @user2 is now known as @astudent</span>
<span class="go">@astudent #csc209&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can see who else is currently connected to this server:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">@astudent #csc209&gt; /who</span>
<span class="go">!   @pdm (#csc209)</span>
<span class="go">!   @astudent (#csc209)</span>
<span class="go">@astudent #csc209&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When using <em>chatclient</em>, notice that your prompt is being updated to reflect
your current nick name and channel membership (by default, new users should
join the <em>csc209</em> channel.) This prompt display mechanism is a feature of
<em>chatclient</em>, but is implemented simply by the server sending the client a
command <code>/prompt</code> command. You can see the raw behaviour in effect by using
<em>netcat</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">wolf:~$</span> /bin/nc -v localhost 20209
<span class="go">Connection to localhost 20209 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</span>
<span class="go">! Welcome to the CSC209 Chat Server</span>
<span class="go">! Type /help &lt;ENTER&gt; to see a list of available commands</span>
<span class="go"> * @user2 has joined #csc209</span>
<span class="go">/prompt @user2 #csc209</span>
<span class="go">/nick astudent</span>
<span class="go">/prompt @astudent #csc209</span>
<span class="go"> * @user2 is now known as @astudent</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>/prompt ...</code> text is is being sent by the server and received by the client.</p>
<p>This server supports (as will yours soon) hosting conversations in multiple
named named <em>channels</em>. Users can create any channel they wish simply by
joining it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">@astudent #csc209&gt; /join a4</span>
<span class="go"> * @astudent has joined #a4</span>
<span class="go">@astudent #a4&gt; /who</span>
<span class="go">!   @pdm (#csc209)</span>
<span class="go">!   @astudent (#a4)</span>
<span class="go">@astudent #a4&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Aside from commands, anything else that a user enters will be sent to all members of the current channel:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">@astudent #a4&gt; /join csc209</span>
<span class="go"> * @astudent has joined #csc209</span>
<span class="go">@astudent #csc209&gt; is anyone here?</span>
<span class="go">astudent: is anyone here?</span>
<span class="go">pdm: welcome!</span>
<span class="go">@astudent #csc209&gt; thanks!</span>
<span class="go">astudent: thanks!</span>
<span class="go">@astudent #csc209&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Experiment with this server, and notice the various messages that are reported.
Especially try with two concurrent client connections; the server will inform
you when other clients have joined or are leaving the current channel.</p>
<h2 id="starter-code">Starter Code</h2>
<p>Before you can start the assignment, you <strong>MUST</strong> download the starter code and
commit it to your Subversion repository under the <code>a4</code> directory. You can
access the code by 3 means:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="a4_files/csc209h1y_2015-a4_starter_code-r1.tar">By downloading a tarball</a> (current revision <strong>1</strong>): from the CDF shell, you can use <em><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/wget.1.html">wget(1)</a></em> followed by this URL to download the archive to your current working directory.</li>
<li><a href="a4_files/a4_starter_code/">From the course website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pdmccormick/csc209-summer-2015/tree/master/assignments/a4_files/a4_starter_code">From the course GitHub repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever method you prefer, ensure that you have all <strong>12</strong> files of the
starter code.</p>
<p>The starter code consists of two parts. The first is a fully functional and
completed <em>chat client</em>, and the second is a corresponding but as-yet
incomplete <em>chat server</em>. For this assignment you will be completing the server
portion.</p>
<p>The following files from the starter code are <em>incomplete</em>, and thus you <strong>MUST</strong>
complete them according to the embedded <code>TODO FIXME</code> comments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chatserver.c</code>: the main socket setup and <code>select</code> event loop of the chat server</li>
<li><code>client.c</code>: routines to handle manipulating the <code>Client</code> data type, representing active TCP/IP connections made to the server</li>
<li><code>channel.c</code>: routines to handle manipulating the <code>Channel</code> data type, representing currently active channels on the server</li>
<li><code>command.c</code>: routines for dealing with and responding to client <code>/command</code>s</li>
</ul>
<p>The following files in the starter code are complete and <em>do not</em> require any
modification, but you will be required to understand what they are doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>defs.h</code>: definitions of the <code>Server</code>, <code>Client</code> and <code>Channel</code> data types; you <strong>MUST</strong> study these definitions carefully, as they are the essential glue that ties together the pieces of the server implementation</li>
<li><code>chatclient.c</code>: a small, fully functional TCP/IP client application that provides a convenient interface to the chat server</li>
<li><code>channel.h</code>, <code>client.h</code> and <code>command.h</code>: the header files with prototype definitions for the corresponding C source</li>
<li><code>util.c</code> and <code>util.h</code>: small parsing utility routines shared between the client and server</li>
<li><code>Makefile</code>: builds both <em>chatserver</em> and <em>chatclient</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>In this assignment, your task is to complete the implementation of a chat
server application by filling in all the necessary socket code. Much of the
structure of this server has already been provided in the form of the core data
types and associated manipulation routines, but several critical pieces of user
facing functionality has yet to be added.</p>
<p>execution of command line tools and programs. Early in the course, we worked
with the Unix shell, and more recently we have studied Unix processes and
pipes. It is time to put all of this together and write your own mini-shell
that can almost give <em>Bash</em> a run for its money.</p>
<p>Your shell should allow running command line programs that have zero, one or
multiple arguments. Commands can be <em>built-in</em> functions where no process is
spawned, simple <em>non-builtin</em> commands where a process is spawned to execute
them, and complex <em>non-builtin</em> commands where an operator such as a pipe (|)
is used to chain commands. You should build this functionality into your shell
one at a time using the steps recommended below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and commit the starter code; read through all of the starter code, especially the comments. You will not be able to make progress until you understand the basic structures and the control flow.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Implement the necessary socket setup code in <code>server_setup</code> (from <code>chatserver.c</code>)<ul>
<li>After this, you should be able to use <em>netcat</em> to almost connect to your server (it will be listening on a bound TCP port), but it will not yet be able to respond in any meaningful way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Implement the <em>select</em> event loop in <code>server_run</code> (from <code>chatserver.c</code>), new connection handling code in <code>server_accept_new_client</code> (from <code>chatserver.c</code>) and the first item for <code>client_close</code> (from <code>client.c</code>)<ul>
<li>After this, you will be able to connect to your server and it will receive client input</li>
<li>You should be able to send a <code>/help</code> command and see a response from the server</li>
<li>Your server will be able to properly handle clients who disconnect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Complete the rest of <code>client_close</code>, <code>channel_broadcast</code>, <code>channel_add_client</code> and <code>channel_remove_client</code> (from <code>channel.c</code>)<ul>
<li>Make sure you understand what the functions defined in <code>client.c</code> can do for you!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Implement <code>command_join</code> (from <code>command.c</code>) and then the final piece of <code>server_handle_client_input</code> (from <code>chatserver.c</code>):<ul>
<li>After this, your server should be able to correctly respond to <code>/join</code> commands, and if you make more than one client connection to the server, those clients should be able to exchange chat messages back and forth within a channel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step 6</strong>: Implement the rest of the <code>command_*</code> functions (from <code>command.c</code>) in order to handle <em>/nick</em>, <em>/who</em> and <em>/channels</em> commands</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-data-types">The Data Types</h2>
<p>Whenever you are writing a server that can handle multiple concurrent client
connections, carefully and cleanly organizing your data structures to keep
track of everything will be hugely beneficial.</p>
<p>For this assignment, 3 key data types have been defined for you in <code>defs.h</code>:
<code>Server</code>, <code>Client</code> and <code>Channel</code>. They are each responsible for keeping track
of one aspect of the chat server, and they contain many mutual pointers among
them.</p>
<p>While most of the delicate handling code has already been provided for you in
the starter code, it is through these data types that you will be able to
complete this assignment, so carefully studying them and understanding their
purpose is vital.</p>
<p>You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to modify any of these definitions in order to complete the
assignment. If you wish, you may add extra fields to add new features and
capabilities, but if you find yourself thinking that they are <em>incomplete</em> in
some essential sense, ask yourself why and post your questions to Piazza.</p>
<h3 id="the-server-structure">The <code>Server</code> structure</h3>
<p>This structure contains all the required socket and <em>select</em> infrastructure, as
way as tracks all the currently connected clients and currently registered
channels on the server (the provided starter code in <code>channel.c</code> and <code>client.c</code>
already correctly manage the <code>clients</code> and <code>channels</code> fields for you.)</p>
<p>Think of this structure as the root of a graph of pointers, with references to
dynamically allocated <code>Client</code> and <code>Channel</code> structures associated with the
current operation of the server (each of which have pointers back into this
root structure and amongst themselves.)</p>

<h3 id="the-client-structure">The <code>Client</code> structure</h3>
<p>Each time a new client connection is accepted by the server, a new <code>Client</code>
structure is dynamically allocated and linked into a free slot in
<code>Servers.clients</code> (see <code>client_new</code> from <code>client.c</code>; this is already provided
for you.) This structure keeps track of the socket file descriptor and client
address of that connection, as well as the nick name of the client and
whichever channel they are currently in.</p>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p><em>Note:</em> The <code>server_clients</code> and <code>channel_clients</code> fields are pointers to the
respective array index slot containing a pointer (hence a double pointer) from
<code>Server.clients</code> and <code>Channel.clients</code> that currently point to this client. In
this way, when removing a client from the system, instead of searching each of
<code>Server.clients</code> for a particular pointer, in order to NULL out that array
index slot, the client tracks where it is in that list and can thus easily
remove itself. This trick is used here as well as by the <code>Channel</code> type.</p>
<h3 id="the-channel-structure">The <code>Channel</code> structure</h3>
<p>Each channel has a unique name on the server, as well as a list of all current
member clients. The provided routines in <code>channel.c</code> deal with setting up and
manipulating this structure.</p>

<h2 id="list-of-required-changes">List of Required Changes</h2>
<p>From <code>chatserver.c</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>server_setup</code>: Complete the server socket setup procedure</li>
<li><code>server_run</code>: Complete the <em>select</em> event loop</li>
<li><code>server_accept_new_client</code>: Complete the setup of new client connections</li>
<li><code>server_handle_client_input</code>: Ensure that chat messages are broadcasted to all members of the channel</li>
</ol>
<p>From <code>client.c</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>client_close</code>: When closing a client connection:<ul>
<li>Remove its socket file descriptor from the servers' <code>all_sock_fds</code> set</li>
<li>Use <code>channel_remove_client</code> to remove them from whatever channel they were in</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> The implementations of <code>client_new</code>, <code>client_write</code>, <code>client_printf</code> and <code>client_addrstr</code> are already complete, but it will be very helpful to understand what they can do for you!</p>
<p>From <code>channel.c</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>channel_broadcast</code>: Send a message to all clients currently in a channel</li>
<li><code>channel_add_client</code>: When a client joins a channel, broadcast a notice message to everyone in the channel</li>
<li><code>channel_remove_client</code>: When a client joins a channel, broadcast a notice message to everyone in the channel</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> The implementations of <code>channel_find</code> and <code>channel_new</code> are already complete, and these functions will be useful when implementing the <em>/join</em> command. Also, <code>channel_broadcast_printf</code> will work correctly once you implement <code>channel_broadcast</code>, and you will similarly find it very useful.</p>
<p>From <code>command.c</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>command_join</code>: Implement a client joining a channel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>command_nick</code>: Implement a client changing their nick name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>command_disconnect</code>: Add a departing message to the <em>/disconnect</em> command handler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>command_channels</code>: Implement a channel listing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>command_who</code>: Implement a listing of who else is a currently connected client</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to Submit</h2>
<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> begin this assignment by checking in all of the starter code under
the <code>a4</code> directory within your repository.</p>
<p>If you forget to add a file or forget to commit a change, there is nothing that
the course staff will be able to do for you.</p>
<p>While understanding the entire organization of the server is necessary, you only have to make modifications to the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chatserver.c</code></li>
<li><code>client.c</code></li>
<li><code>channel.c</code></li>
<li><code>command.c</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Search for the <code>TODO FIXME</code> comments and make sure you implement all the required functionality.</p>
<h2 id="submission-checklist">Submission Checklist</h2>
<p>Commit early and commit often (at least every 2-3 hours that you spend working
on the assignment.) Consider this as insurance against any last minute SVN
problems, or against possibly missing a deadline.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things that you should do on the CDF server at least an hour
before the assignment deadline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new temporary directory in your account (different from the one you are working on the assignment from, and not even a subdirectory within that one)</li>
<li>Check out a fresh copy of your repository into this empty directory</li>
<li>Ensure that all the correct files have been committed, and that they are the latest versions you expected them to be</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> and ensure that <code>chatserver</code> and all of its prerequisites compile without warnings or errors.</li>
<li>Run the <em>chatserver</em> on an unused TCP port of your choosing, and in a second SSH connection window, use <em>chatclient</em> to connect to the server</li>
<li>Open a third SSH connection and run <em>chatclient</em> yet again; in both clients, try changing your name with the /nick command, joining other channels with /join, execute the /who and /channels commands and ensure you see both clients, and check that chat messages are correctly delivered</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that your submission <strong>MUST</strong> compile and run correctly on CDF,
without exception.</p>
